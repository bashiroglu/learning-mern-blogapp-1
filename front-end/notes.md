# My learning notes for front-end which was taken by me while working on this project

When we use nextjs, we create pages folder and all pages will be rendered from there. We can also create components folder and import our components from there. Remember that, we don't import React because nextjs handle all this staff for us.

If we want to add some extra head tags, we can add by using component called \_document.js,by this we will able to add some tags which can contain our special css or hs files.
